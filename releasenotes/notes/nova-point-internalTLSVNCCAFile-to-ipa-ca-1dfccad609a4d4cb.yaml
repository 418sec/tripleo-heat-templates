    In case the freeipa CA is a sub CA of an external CA the InternalTLSVncCAFile
    requrested does not have the full CA chain and only have the free IPA
    CA. As a result qemu which can not verify the vnc certificate sent by
    the vnc-proxy. The issue is in certmonger as it does not return the full
    CA chain.
    As a workaround, until certmonger is fixed, this change points the
    InternalTLSVncCAFile to /etc/ipa/ca.crt which has the full CA chain.
